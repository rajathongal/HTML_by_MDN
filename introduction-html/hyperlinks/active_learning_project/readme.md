# Active learning project - navigation menu

For this exercise, we'd like you to link some pages together with a navigation menu to create a multipage website. This is one common way in which a website is created — the same page structure is used on every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place, and different content is being brought up.

You'll need to make local copies of the following four pages, all in the same directory. For a complete file list, see the [navigation-menu-start directory](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start):

You should:

- Add an unordered list in the indicated place on one page that includes the names of the pages to link to. A navigation menu is usually just a list of links, so this is semantically OK.
- Change each page name into a link to that page.
- Copy the navigation menu across to each page.
- On each page, remove just the link to that same page — it's confusing and unnecessary for a page to include a link to itself. And, the lack of a link acts a good visual reminder of which page you are currently on.
- The finished example should look similar to the following page:
